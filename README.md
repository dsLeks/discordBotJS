# discordBotJS
Implemented a discord bot using the discordjs API

Using the discordjs API I implemented a discord Bot that allows a user to enter a pre-defined command and the Bot will query a database that will return the result
and the bot will display these results. The bot is hosted on replit. The databse (Online Retail Database - which can be found in my other repository)

To test the Bot do the following: 

1. Go to https://replit.com/join/otaaapbmir-alekhyahello and run the bot. 
2. Go to my discord server: https://discord.gg/jFm6vREMux 
3. Test Bot with commands starting with `/` - a Popup with all available commands will be visible.
